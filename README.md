# QOC
This package is an implementation of GRAPE using [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) to perform automatic
differentiation. This package provides an extensible framework for cost functions and supports problems on
the Schroedinger Equation and the Lindblad Master Equation.

Formal documentation for this package does not exist, but the code is heavily commented.
See the [Tutorial](https://github.com/SchusterLab/qoc/tree/master/examples) to get started
or check out the [docstring](https://github.com/SchusterLab/qoc/blob/master/qoc/core/schroedingerdiscrete.py#L123)
for the core functions.

### Installation ###
You can install QOC via pip.
